      "value": "<p>At 1st level, the Martyr learns to channel their own vitality into a unique resource. When you choose your Mortal Devotion at 3rd level, you commit to either the Path of the Moon (Vengeance) or the Path of the Sun (Mercy). You have a number of Vengeance or Mercy points equal to your Martyr level Ã— Your Constitution modifier. You do not have a limit at level 20.</p><p>Any excess fades when you finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>You gain points in the following ways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Vengeance (Path of the Moon):</strong> When you take damage, you gain a number of Vengeance points equal to half the damage taken, up to your maximum. This gain is applied after resistances or vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Mercy (Path of the Sun):</strong> When an ally within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to gain a number of Mercy points equal to half the damage they took, up to your maximum.</li></ul><p>You can only gain a maximum of 7 points per turn.</p><p>You can use these points to fuel various Martyr abilities and spells. When you spend Vengeance or Mercy points, they are gone until you regain them. You can't gain Vengeance and Mercy points simultaneously; your chosen path dictates which resource you use.</p>",
