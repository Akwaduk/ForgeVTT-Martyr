## 📥 Installation

1. **Foundry UI**  
   *System → Add-on Modules → Install Module*  
   Paste this manifest URL (or pick it from the browser):
2. **Enable the module** in *Manage Modules* for your world.  
3. **Import compendia** (`Martyr Classes`, `Martyr Class Features`, `Martyr Spells`, `Martyr Subclasses`).

---

## 🚀 Quick-start

1. Create or open a character.  
2. From the **Martyr Classes** compendium, drag the **Martyr** class onto the sheet.  
3. At **3rd level**, choose either **Disciple of the Moon** or **Disciple of the Sun**.

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

### Vengeance / Mercy Points
| Resource | How you gain it | Cap |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| **Vengeance**<br>(Moon) | ½ the damage **you** take (rounded up, max 7 / turn) | `Level × CON mod` |
| **Mercy**<br>(Sun) | ½ the damage an **ally** takes that you witness (reaction, max 7 / turn) | `Level × CON mod` |

### Blood-Magic Highlights
* No spell-slot progression—every spell costs points.  
* **16 unique spells** spanning all levels from 1st to 9th
* Signature spells: **Flesh Bolt**, **Bloodreign**, **Absolution**, **Vindicate** (and more).  
* Each spell scales with the points you invest and your character level.
* **Path-specific spells**: Some spells only available to Moon or Sun disciples
