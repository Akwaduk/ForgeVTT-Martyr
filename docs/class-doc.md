## The Martyr

The Martyr understands that suffering is the ultimate path to self-realization. They obtain their powers through a profound connection to either the Sun or the Moon, aligning with paths of Mercy or Vengeance. Whether channeling the benevolent radiance of the Sun for healing and protection, or the wrathful shadows of the Moon for inflicting suffering, a Martyr's power is forged in sacrifice. Depending on their chosen path, they bear stigmata, spiritual wounds that glow with either moonlight or sunlight, a testament to their sacred pact.

### The Art of Dying
The Martyr's unique connection allows them to convert their own vitality into a potent resource. Those aligned with the **Moon** delve into the grim truth that suffering is a prelude to judgment, wielding power through Vengeance to punish their foes. Their path might lead them to pacts with spectres of the Blood Moon: Acilla Tem (Conquest), Egam Hetad (War), Xerthana (Famine), and Reyulsa (Death).

Martyrs of the **Sun**, however, embrace the idea that suffering can lead to redemption and healing. They channel Mercy, sacrificing their own well-being to restore allies and protect the innocent. Their light is a beacon against destruction, and their sacrifice a shield for those in need.

## Creating a Martyr
As you create your Martyr, consider the nature of their suffering. Is it a self-inflicted discipline, a burden taken on for others, or a consequence of a profound experience? What led them to this path of channeling power through pain or sacrifice? Do they truly believe suffering is the ultimate path, or is it merely a means to an end?

What deity or philosophy do they align with? Is it a specific sun god or moon deity, or a more abstract concept of cosmic balance or primal force? How do these beliefs shape their actions and interactions with the world?

### Quick Build
You can make a Martyr quickly by following these suggestions. First, make your highest ability score **Constitution**, which will fuel your abilities and determine your spellcasting modifier. Your next highest score should be **Wisdom**, which is crucial for many of your saving throws and for understanding the deeper truths of your path.

## Vengeance and Mercy
At 1st level, the Martyr learns to channel their own vitality into a unique resource. When you choose your Mortal Devotion at 3rd level, you commit to either the Path of the Moon (Vengeance) or the Path of the Sun (Mercy). You have a number of Vengeance or Mercy points equal to your Martyr level * Your Constitution modifier. You do not have a limit at level 20. 

Any excess fades when you finish a long rest.

You gain points in the following ways:
- **Vengeance (Path of the Moon):** When you take damage, you gain a number of Vengeance points equal to half the damage taken, up to your maximum. This gain is applied after resistances or vulnerabilities.
- **Mercy (Path of the Sun):** When an ally within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to gain a number of Mercy points equal to half the damage they took, up to your maximum.

You can only gain a maximum of 7 points per turn.

You can use these points to fuel various Martyr abilities and spells. When you spend Vengeance or Mercy points, they are gone until you regain them. You can't gain Vengeance and Mercy points simultaneously; your chosen path dictates which resource you use.

### Martyr's Insight
Starting at 1st level, your understanding of suffering grants you unique insights. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Medicine, Intimidation, or Religion.

### Double-Edged Blade
At 2nd level, you learn to imbue your attacks with your life force. Before you make an attack roll, you can choose to take necrotic damage (for Martyr of the Moon) or radiant damage (for Martyr of the Sun) equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). If the attack hits, you add an additional amount of the chosen damage type equal to your Chosen modifier to the damage roll. This can only be used once per turn.

### Martyr Spellcasting
Also at 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast spells as a Martyr. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the Martyr spell list.

**Spell Slots:** You do not gain normal spell slots.  Instead you prepare blood magics as described in the Blood-Magic Spellcasting table. A Martyr can only cast one bonus action or reaction spell per round.

**Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:** You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Martyr spell list. The Spells Known column of the Martyr table shows when you learn more Martyr spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Martyr spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Martyr spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability:** Charisma or Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Martyr spells, this will depend on your alignment to your deity (Moon = Charisma, Sun = Wisdom) and be referred to as your Chosen modifier. You use this modifier whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use this modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Martyr spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

- **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen modifier
- **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your chosen modifier

### Mortal Devotion
At 3rd level, you devote yourself to a specific path, gaining features at 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 15th level. Choose **Disciple of the Moon** or **Disciple of the Sun**, both detailed at the end of the class description.

### Retribution
Also at 3rd level, your suffering teaches you to respond to threats. When a creature targets you or an ally within 30 feet with an attack, you can use your reaction and expend a number of Vengeance or Mercy points (maximum 5) up to your Chosen modifier.

- **Path of the Moon:** The attacking creature takes necrotic damage equal to the Vengeance points spent.
- **Path of the Sun:** The target of the attack regains hit points equal to the Mercy points spent.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

\page

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Exact Vengeance, Merciful Patience
Starting at 5th level, you can channel your accumulated resource into a powerful burst.

- **Exact Vengeance (Path of the Moon):** After you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend all of your Vengeance points (minimum 10). The creature takes additional necrotic damage equal to half the Vengeance points expended. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
- **Merciful Patience (Path of the Sun):** After you cast a spell that restores hit points to a creature, you can expend all of your Mercy points (minimum 10). The creature regains additional hit points equal to half the Mercy points expended. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Improved Sufferance
Beginning at 9th level, your resilience grows. When you gain Vengeance or Mercy points, you gain an additional 1 point.

## Blood and Thunder, Sacrifice and Atonement
At 10th level, your resource expenditure causes a secondary effect.

- **Blood and Thunder (Path of the Moon):** When you expend Vengeance points to cast a spell or use a class feature, you can choose one creature within 30 feet of you. That creature takes 1d4 thunder damage. This damage increases to 2d4 at 15th level and 3d4 at 20th level.
- **Sacrifice and Atonement (Path of the Sun):** When you expend Mercy points to cast a spell or use a class feature, you can choose one creature within 30 feet of you. That creature regains 1d4 hit points. This healing increases to 2d4 at 15th level and 3d4 at 20th level.

## Indomitable Presence
Beginning at 13th level, you can impose your will upon others. As a bonus action, you can choose any number of creatures within 60 feet of you. Each chosen creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become **taunted** until the end of your next turn. A taunted creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than you. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Improved Retribution
At 14th level, your ability to retaliate grows stronger. When you use your Retribution feature, the amount of Vengeance or Mercy points you can expend is increased to your Chosen modifier + your proficiency bonus. Additionally, the range of the feature increases to 60 feet.

## Vindictive Divinity
Starting at 17th level, you can briefly channel the raw power of your chosen deity. As an action, you can activate this feature. For 1 minute, you gain one of the following benefits based on your path:

- **Path of the Moon:** Your weapon attacks deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend 5 Vengeance points to force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, they are frightened of you until the end of their next turn.
- **Path of the Sun:** Whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points, the healing is maximized. As a bonus action on your turn, you can restore hit points to one creature within 30 feet of you equal to your Martyr level.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Apocalyptic Affinity
Upon reaching 20th level, your mastery over suffering is complete. When an ally within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage they take to 0. You then take the same amount of damage that the ally would have taken. This damage cannot be reduced in any way. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

\page

# Mortal Devotions

The path of the Martyr leads to a profound understanding of life, death, and suffering. Your devotion shapes your powers, aligning them with the harsh judgments of the Moon or the benevolent embrace of the Sun.

## Disciple of the Moon
Disciples of the Moon see death as the ultimate judgment and suffering as the inevitable journey towards it. Your power grows as you inflict pain and witness the demise of others.

### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this devotion at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

### Hellbent
At 3rd level, your bond with suffering makes you resistant to death. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can instead choose to regain a number of hit points equal to your current Vengeance points (minimum 1). You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### Bane of Sisyphus
Starting at 6th level, you draw power from the suffering of your enemies. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Chosen modifier + your Martyr level.

### Impending Conviction
At 11th level, your words carry the weight of your chosen path. When you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, you can expend up to 5 Vengeance points. For each point spent, you gain a +1 bonus to the roll.

### Burden of Existence
Starting at 15th level, you can sacrifice your own vitality to ward off death from an ally. As an action, you can touch a creature that has 0 hit points and is making death saving throws. You can expend all your Vengeance points, and the creature regains hit points equal to half the Vengeance points expended. This feature can't be used to revive a creature killed outright. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Aspect of Death
At 18th level, you embody death's judgment. While you are wielding a sickle, you can use your action to choose one creature within 5 feet of you. This can't be used on undead or constructs. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, if the creature has fewer hit points than your current Vengeance points, it instantly drops to 0 hit points. On a successful save, the creature takes 8d8 necrotic damage. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

\page

## Disciple of the Sun
Disciples of the Sun believe that suffering can be transcended through compassion and healing. You channel benevolent light, taking on burdens to uplift and protect your allies.

### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this devotion at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill. If you are already proficient in it, you gain proficiency in a different skill from the Martyr skill list.

### Undertaker's Sigh
At 3rd level, your presence stabilizes the dying. When a creature within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to stabilize them. They immediately become stable and conscious at 1 hit point, instead of falling unconscious. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Cusp of Greatness
Starting at 6th level, your willingness to sacrifice invigorates your allies. When you cast a spell that restores hit points to an ally, that ally can immediately use their reaction to move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Forgiveness
At 11th level, your compassion can quell aggression. As a reaction when a creature hits you or an ally within 30 feet with an attack, you can expend up to 5 Mercy points. The attacking creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you until the end of its next turn. A charmed creature can't willingly attack the charmer.

### Heaviest Matter of the Universe
Beginning at 15th level, your benevolent aura can impede your foes. As a bonus action, you can create a shimmering sphere of light in a 10-foot radius centered on a point you can see within 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), any hostile creature that starts its turn within the sphere or enters it for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Radiant Intervention
At 18th level, your protective embrace can divert even the most lethal strikes. When an ally within 60 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to absorb up to half of that damage. You take the absorbed damage as radiant damage, and your ally takes the remaining damage. This damage taken by you cannot be reduced in any way. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
